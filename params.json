Various people liked it and the three crazy people, Sérgio Basto, Pavlo Rudyi and David Vasquez created the UnitedRPMs Project. \r\n\r\n### What is the purpose of this project?\r\n\r\nWell, to maintain a solution for people with unstable Fedora distributions, improve our technical skills, create a [Copr](https://copr.fedoraproject.org/)-like build system for package with licensing problems. UnitedRPMs it's not a branch maintenance of other projects, it is only a way to give the user a fast solution without foolish bureaucracy where everyone can help.\r\n\r\n### Why doesn't UnitedRPMs contribute to RPMFusion?\r\n\r\nOur models of development are very different. We believe in a flexible ecosystem where everyone can be helpful to the community without stupid bureaucracy and without being a lone rider. Some of our packages were reworked from RPMFusion and can be used by everyone; unofficially as extended rpmfusion rawhide. You can find a list of all contributors [here](https://github.com/orgs/UnitedRPMs/people), the specs and source code are also available on Github.  \r\nExcept for Sérgio Basto, who is an RPMFusion contributor and likes to think this project is an extension of RPMFusion.\r\n\r\n  \r\n### Support or Contact\r\n\r\nHaving trouble with any package or UnitedRPMs repository?
