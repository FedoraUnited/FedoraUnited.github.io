Various people liked it and the three crazy people, Sérgio Basto, Pavlo Rudyi and David Vasquez created the UnitedRPMs Project. \r\n\r\n### What is the purpose of this project?\r\n\r\nWell, maintain a solution for people with unstable Fedora distributions, increase technical skills, create a [Copr](https://copr.fedoraproject.org/)-like build system for package with licensing problems. UnitedRPMs it's not a branch maintenance of other projects, it is only a road to give the user a fast solution without fool bureaucracy where everyone can help.\r\n\r\n### Why UnitedRPMs not contributes to RPMFusion?\r\n\r\nOur models of development are very different. We believe in flexible ecosystem where everyone can be helpful for the community without stupid bureaucracy and didn't be an alone rider. Some of our packages were reworked from RPMFusion and can be used by everyone; unofficially as extended rpmfusion rawhide. List of all contributors you can find [here](https://github.com/orgs/UnitedRPMs/people), as specs and source code is also available on Github.  \r\nExcept Sérgio Basto which is a RPMFusion contributor and like to think this project is an extension of RPMFusion.\r\n\r\n  \r\n### Support or Contact\r\n\r\nHaving trouble with any package or Fedora United repository?
